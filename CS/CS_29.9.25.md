# Data protection
-------------------------
### Phishing vs Pharming
> - Phishing is when you click on a suspicious link and have your information stolen
> - Pharming is when, by exploiting weaknesses in DNS servers, you get redirected to a malicious site from a legitimate one

HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
HTTPS: HTTP but security
# HTTPS/SSL/TLS
### SSL
> - SSL stands for secure socket layer
> - it's the original website handshake security measure
> - deprecated for a long time
> - Typically refers to TLS now


-# the cloud doesnt exist, it's just other's servers
### TLS
> - TLS stands for transport layer security
> - Modern handshake system
> - It provides a secure encrypted connection between the client and server (frontend & backend)
> - When the site protocol is https://, that means that a form of SSL is being used
> - The client begins the handshake by sending a client hello post, containing the cryptographic preference
> - The server responds with a server hello message containing domain name, ssl certificate, and public encryption
> - Browsers will try everything to stop you from accessing sites with expired ssl certificates
> - If the server's ssl certificate is legitimate, the client generates a random session key, that the server can decrypt
> - The server then sends a server finish message, and the client responds with a client finish message
### Protocols
> - protocols in this sense are methods of transferring data, such as HTTP or POSTGRES (http://, postgres://)
> - normally protocols just means instructions

#### primary storage is required for the system to run, secondary isn't

## cd vs dvd vs bluray
> - all optical
> - all portable (offline)
> - all secondary


modems translate analog signals to digital and back
RAM is volatile; it loses its data when the computer shuts down
any other one that keeps its data after shutdown is non-volatile
