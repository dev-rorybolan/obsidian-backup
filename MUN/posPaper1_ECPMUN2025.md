# Position Paper 1: Discussing resource allocation in disputed regions
---
### Details
- Committee: SpecPol
- Topic: Discussing resource allocation in disputed regions
- Country: United States of America
- School: The English College in Prague


### Topic background
- Because multiple states claim disputed lands, such as the Navassa Island (claimed by Haiti and the USA), resource allocation often leads to disputes between the contending states.
- For instance, Western Sahara has phosphate reserves, rich fishing waters and offshore oil and gas resources, and ownership of these resources leads to tension and conflicts between Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguia el-Hamra y Río de Oro (Polisario front).

### Country position
- The United States acknowledges that competition over natural resources in disputed territories can escalate into conflicts that threaten regional and global stability, and by extension, the American economy and security.
- The United States is able to negotiate resolutions and solutions where being involved would benefit the American economy and security.
- Any and all resolutions must prioritise the most stable and responsible manager for resource extraction, and the United States is the prime example of such capability. 
- For instance, Western Sahara has offshore oil deposits, however also has rich fishing waters. If the oil was taken advantage of, leakages would pollute and damage the rich fishing waters. The United States possesses the highest quality environmental and technological standards globally, and American businesses are the most capable and reliable partners for the development of resources, ensuring strong economic progress.

### Past action
- The US has always promoted and believed in the right of sovereign nations to control their own resources and destiny. Our leadership post-WW2 established a system that prioritised national strength and economic growth.
- The US participates in certain international bodies like the United Nations to the extent that they serve American interests. However, the United States always reserves the right to act freely to protect its citizens and assets when these organisations prove insufficient or ineffective.
- The US has used its economic and diplomatic power to secure many trade agreements that ensure stable resource access for the American economy. Our focus is on fair and balanced agreements that put American workers and industries first.


### Possible solutions
- The United States believes resource disputes should be settled through direct negotiations or, when necessary, third-party mediation rather than relying on slow, costly, and often biased international courts (such as the ICJ) or entrenched UN bureaucracies. 
-  Encouragement of joint development zones, however only with clear legal frameworks in order to prevent unfair practices and protect American interests. 
- Any aid or technical assistance provided by the US will be strictly conditioned on the receiving nation with the intent of providing fair trade, responsible governance, and a strategic partnership with the United States.
- The United States will use its position as a global leader in energy production to ensure energy independence and stability for its allies. Solutions for offshore resources should prioritise the security of global supply chains, often best facilitated by American companies.
