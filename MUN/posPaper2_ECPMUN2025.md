# Position Paper 2:  Addressing the disparities in technological resources and developments in post-colonial nations
---
- Committee: SpecPol
- Topic: Discussing resource allocation in disputed regions
- Country: United States of America
- School: The English College in Prague
## Topic background
- Often, post-colonial nations have a significant technological gap between them and their colonisers. This gap frequently hinders the growth of the economy.
- This stems from multiple reasons, such as the extraction of resources without significant reinvestment, or education structured to benefit those who colonised the area.
- This can and does lead to political instability and bigger healthcare gaps.
- For example, when Ghana received independence from Britain, a large technological gap remained, due to the fact that, as opposed to technological advancements in the area, Britain simply used Ghana as a source of resources such as cocoa or gold.

## Country position
- The United States recognises the significant gaps in technological resources and development in post-colonial countries and states with more industrialisation, but believes that addressing these gaps would hinder overall global development if resources were to be allocated to developing countries, rather than being used to further technological advancements. Instead, the USA supports market-driven cooperation and mutually beneficial partnerships that enable developing nations to access technology through trade, investment, and education, rather than relying on direct aid.
- The US supports public-private partnerships that involve American companies, creating opportunities for investment, infrastructure export, and the expansion of US digital industries abroad.
- The United States is not willing to support the development of countries that struggle with corruption, as it has been observed that in nations with high levels of corruption, aid and international support are often misused, leading to dependency and wasted resources.



## Past action
- The United States implemented the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP) in 2018. which promotes open, secure, and reliable internet in developing countries, mostly in the Indo-Pacific and Africa.
- The United States launched USAID's Digital Strategy, which focused on improving digital access and literacy in partner countries.
- The USA has collaborated with the World Bank and the [ITU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union) to improve cybersecurity frameworks and enhance digital skills training in post-colonial countries.

## Possible solutions
- The USA supports initiatives that encourage post-colonial nations to build their own domestic, independent, self-sustaining technical industries, as opposed to relying on foreign aid. 
- Technological aid from the United States should be mutually beneficial, such as if receiving countries were to use American products, contractors, or regulatory standards
- The USA encourages the use of high-quality American-made technologies to advance development goals while promoting global standards of excellence.
