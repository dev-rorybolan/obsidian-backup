Concerned by the lack of resource management within disputed territories,
Acknowledging the challenge of diplomacy between contending states,
Understanding that the resources within these territories would benefit all parties' economies if harvested,
Recalling the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations regarding the peaceful settlement of disputes,  
Noting with concern the ongoing competition over natural resources in disputed territories such as Kashmir, and Western Sahara,  
Recognising that equitable resource management can contribute to regional stability and sustainable development,  


1: Encourages member states that contend over territory to engage in bilateral negotiations to manage resources;
2: Calls upon the United Nations to establish a new committee of the General Assembly for the purpose of handling and solving issues and conflicts relating to or similar to this;
3: Encourages NGOs to assist in mediating the conflict;
4: Calls upon the contending parties do decide on a neutral third party as mediator to manage and allocate resources;
4.5: Calls upon the United Nations to choose a country neutral to the conflict to manage resources if a decision cannot be made between the contending states and they are within a stalemate or a most violent dispute;
5: Calls upon the International Court of Justice to manage resources if the contending countries do not respect the resolution of the third party mediator;
