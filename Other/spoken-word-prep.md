# spoken word poem - ENGLISH
1. What is an issue in your school or local community that you feel passionate about calling attention to and why?
	Student wellbeing -> bullying, normalised homophobia/transphobia/xenophobia/racism/etc
2. What would you like to say about this issue?
	These are real people that are being singled out and tormented for being different, and 99 times out of 100 they can't help it.
3. What story or stories do you have which could help your audience understand your message?
	I realise that I have had a very privileged life, and by that I mean that I have never had to face the hardships that others may face, be it homophobia, racism, or anything else.
4. What powerful images can you use to help your audience understand the message you want to convey?
	The whole concept of being closeted, as if how you identify and being open about it is something that should be dictated by others. People could say that getting addressed as a guy makes them feel uncomfortable and dysphoric, and yet there will be others that still do it, because they don't seem to understand that there's a real person on the other end of their harassment. It doesn't matter that they "don't understand" or "find it too complicated", there are people who would be more than happy to explain it to them, rather than having em going around calling people slurs and other degrading names that make them begin to fear going to school.
