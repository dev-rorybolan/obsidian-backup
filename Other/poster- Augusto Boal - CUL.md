<p align="right" style="color: blue">Augusto Boal was a political activist, but most importantly was a theatre practitioner and developed the Theatre of the Oppressed.<br>He was a member of the radical left, and because of this he shaped the Theatre of the Oppressed as a tool for social change, rather than just a form of entertainment.<br>He was inspired by the totalitarian regime that Brazil was under at the time, as well as the works of Paulo Friere</p>

<p align="right" style="color: green"> The Theatre of the Oppressed was a form of theatre in which the audience participates (they're known as spect-actors) by stopping the performance and suggesting/rehearsing solutions to the problems being displayed.<br>The main goal of Boal was to inspire and empower people to overcome oppression, and he saw the Theatre of the Oppressed as a way to do so.</p>
