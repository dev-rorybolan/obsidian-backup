I am honestly appalled that people will try and justify judging others fo  how they look, what they wear, how they want to be addressed, or even who they like is a very common issue and its 'honestly pointless. There is genuinely no reason for it. It's not like it's uncommon, almost 20% of people under 30 are openly queer, and this number is much bigger in reality, as it doesn't take into account closeted people or people who simply chose not to answer on said censuses. 
While on the topic of being closeted, that's something else that people find normal but I despise. As if how you identify and how open you are about it is something that should be dictated by others. If, let's say, someone is AMAB, however doesn't associate with the gender binary and would like to be addressed as such, addressing them by a name or pronouns different to what they ask for just because you don't like them or find it weird is to me a revolting, cheap, sleazy attack, and it tells me a lot about the person saying it. On the other hand, if someone simply doesn't understand, and they go to someone who does to ask for help in understanding this, that makes me happy, because they very easily could have grown to resent people simply for being different, rather than trying to understand and support
