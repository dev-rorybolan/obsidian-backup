I am honestly **appalled** that people will try and justify judging others for how they look %, what they wear %, how they want to be addressed %, or even who they !like is a very common issue and it's *pointless* . There is |genuinely no reason for it. -It's not like it's uncommon, almost /20% of people under 30 are openly queer, and this number is much bigger in reality, as it doesn't take into account closeted people % -or people who #!simply #**chose not** to answ^er on said censuses. 
?While on the topic of being closeted, that's !(something else) that people find normal but I **despise**. ?(As if how you identify)% and ?(how open you are about it) is #**something** that should be ^dictated by others. If%, let's say%, someone is AMAB, however doesn't associate with the gender binary and would like to be addressed as such, addressing them by a name or pronouns different to what they ask for just because you don't like them or find it weird is to me a revolting, cheap, sleazy attack, and it tells me a lot about the person saying it. On the other hand, if someone simply doesn't understand, and they go to someone who does to ask for help in understanding this, that makes me happy, because they very easily could have grown to resent people simply for being different, rather than trying to understand and support it.

#### Key:
- % -> small pause
- ! -> crescendo
- *italics* -> say it slowly with purpose
- **bold** -> sharp exhale, angry tone
- / -> emphasis
- | -> get caught at the beginning, i.e. "gggenuinely" "rrre^volting"
- '-' -> possibly not said or just partially said, i.e "-It's not the reason I'm here" becomes " 's not the reason I'm here"
- ^ -> increase volume, not crescendo just louder
- \#\<symbol> -> half the effect of another symbol
- ? -> decrescendo
- \<symbol>(\<text>) -> the symbol is applied to all the text inside the brackets
